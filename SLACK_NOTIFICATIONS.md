# Turning Off Slack Notifications

## ⚠️ Important: Manual Action Required

**Slack notifications in this Upptime repository are controlled by GitHub repository secrets.** These secrets cannot be modified programmatically from automated tools or GitHub Actions. A repository administrator with appropriate permissions must manually delete or disable these secrets.

## Overview

This document provides step-by-step instructions for turning off Slack notifications in this Upptime repository.

## How Upptime Notifications Work

Upptime uses GitHub repository secrets (environment variables) to control all notification integrations, including Slack. **There is no configuration in `.upptimerc.yml` that controls notifications** - everything is managed through GitHub Actions secrets.

## Current Status

If Slack secrets are not configured, notifications are already disabled. Otherwise, follow the steps below to disable them.

## Steps to Disable Slack Notifications

### Option 1: Delete Slack Secrets (Recommended)

1. Navigate to the repository on GitHub: https://github.com/FamilyFirstAPD/ff-uptime

2. Go to **Settings** → **Secrets and variables** → **Actions**

3. Look for the following secrets and delete them:
   - `NOTIFICATION_SLACK`
   - `NOTIFICATION_SLACK_WEBHOOK`
   - `NOTIFICATION_SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL`

4. For each secret:
   - Click on the secret name
   - Click the **Remove secret** button
   - Confirm the deletion

### Option 2: Disable Without Deleting

If you want to keep the Slack webhook URL for potential future use:

1. Update `NOTIFICATION_SLACK` secret to `false`
2. This will disable notifications while preserving the webhook configuration

## Verification

After removing or disabling the secrets:

1. Trigger the Upptime workflow manually:
   - Go to **Actions** tab
   - Select "Uptime CI" workflow
   - Click "Run workflow"

2. Monitor the next scheduled run (every 5 minutes)

3. Verify that no Slack notifications are sent

## Re-enabling Slack Notifications

To re-enable Slack notifications in the future:

1. Add or update the following secrets:
   ```
   NOTIFICATION_SLACK=true
   NOTIFICATION_SLACK_WEBHOOK=true
   NOTIFICATION_SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL=<your-slack-webhook-url>
   ```

2. Get a new Slack webhook URL from your Slack workspace if needed:
   - Go to your Slack workspace settings
   - Navigate to Apps → Incoming Webhooks
   - Create or copy your webhook URL

## Additional Information

- **No code changes required**: All notification settings are managed through GitHub secrets
- **Workflow files**: The workflow files in `.github/workflows/` are auto-generated by Upptime and should not be modified directly
- **Configuration file**: `.upptimerc.yml` does not have any notification configuration options
- **Security**: If you believe your Slack webhook may have been compromised, rotate it in Slack before re-enabling
